## CarMaker 3.0 ScriptControl Example - IPG Automotive GmbH (www.ipg.de)
##
## This Example shows how to use the WaitForCondition function.               
## It is important to note that any variables that are passed in the          
## conditional statement must be global variables. In this example            
## the Qu array, declared with global scope, is used. WaitForCondition
## will wait for the velocity of the car to exceed 50 kph. Once the velocity  
## is greater than 50 kph, the speed is printed and the simulation is stopped.
